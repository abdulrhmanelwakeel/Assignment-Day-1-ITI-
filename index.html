    <div id="about"> About me :
        
        My name is Abdulrhman Mohammed Elwakeel, a recent graduate from the Computer Science Department at Ain Shams University. <br>Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong passion for software engineering, which has driven me to continuously seek opportunities to enhance my programming and technical skills.<br>

        I am deeply committed to building a career in software development, with a particular interest in frontend development.<br> My academic background has equipped me with a solid foundation in computer science, including programming languages, algorithms, data structures, and software design principles.<br> However, I believe that learning is a continuous process, and I am eager to expand my expertise by diving deeper into frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React.
        
        Currently, I am focused on sharpening my programming skills to meet the high standards of the tech industry, <br>with a special emphasis on frontend development. I am particularly interested in creating intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that provide seamless experiences.<br> <h2>My goal</h2> is to combine my technical skills with creativity to build responsive and visually appealing web applications.
        
        As I embark on this journey, I am actively seeking an internship opportunity that will allow me to apply my frontend skills, learn from industry experts,<br> and grow as a software engineer. I am confident that with my determination, passion for technology, and eagerness to learn, I can make meaningful contributions to any team and continue to develop as a professional in the field of software engineering, particularly in frontend development.<br>
